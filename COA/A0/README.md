> 1. Load two 32b constants on to $t0 and $t1. Add them and store the result in $t2.

> 2. Load a 32b constant in the memory location pointed to by the global pointer. Load another 32b constant in
the first memory location of the data segment. Add them both and save the sum in the 100 th word of the data
segment.

> 3. Hello World Program. Print “Hello World” on the output screen.

> 4. Initialize a contiguous chunk of memory to contain 10 two digit decimal numbers. Your program should

calculate the sum of these numbers and put the result into $v0.

> 5. Write a program to reverse a string (choose your favorite string as a global parameter).

> 6. Implement a function that calculates the sum of the elements of the array. 

The function accepts the length of the array and the address of the first element of the array. 

The function returns the sum to the caller. The main procedure calculates the average of the elements 

of the array. The main procedure uses the mentioned the function. Use the MIPS compiler subroutine conventions.

> 7. Along the same lines as the previous question, implement a matrix multiplication program using functions.

> 8. Factorial Program. Load a random number in $t0. Calculate its factorial using (a) loops, (b) recursion.
